      The tools created by the BioThings collaboration are funded by grants
      [link to biothings-global page that lists grant sources?]. Although the
      individual data sources included in these tools may be subject to
      restrictions, the tools themselves are free and we would like them to
      remain that way. If you found our tools useful, please help support us by
      spreading the word and demonstrating its value:
